          <h1><u>Biography</u></h1>
          <p class="bio">
            Chris Brown, in full <strong>Christopher Maurice Brown</strong>,
            (born May 5, 1989, Tappahannock, Virginia, U.S.), American
            rhythm-and-blues (R&B) singer, songwriter, and actor whose melodic
            voice and skilled dancing propelled him to fame, though his success
            was sometimes overshadowed by his tumultuous personal life.
            <br />
            Brown grew up in small-town Virginia. As a child, he discovered a
            love for dancing and singing, and, when he was 15 years old, he was
            signed to Jive Records. His first album, a self-titled release,
            debuted in 2005.Sales climbed steadily on the strength of the
            chart-topping single “Run It!” and the quality Brown displayed both
            in vocals and in dancing earned him early comparisons to stars such
            as Usher and Michael Jackson. In 2006 Brown was nominated for two
            Grammy Awards, including best new artist, and in 2007 he expanded
            his entertainment career with roles in the dance drama film Stomp
            the Yard, the popular TV melodrama The O.C., and the holiday
            comedy-drama film This Christmas. In late 2007 he also released his
            second album, Exclusive, which was lauded for showcasing Brown’s
            growing maturity while still appealing to his target teen
            demographic. Exclusive featured collaborations with such big names
            as Lil Wayne and Kanye West, and its single “Kiss Kiss,” featuring
            singer-rapper T-Pain, reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100.
            <br />
            In 2009 Brown’s professional image was tarnished in the wake of his
            felony assault of fellow R&B star Rihanna, who was then his
            girlfriend, for which he was later sentenced to 180 days of
            community labour and five years of supervised probation. The highly
            publicized incident sparked controversy and remained in the media
            for months. Brown’s third album, Graffiti, debuted in December that
            year. Reviews seemed somewhat polarized over his musical expression
            of his turbulent relationship with Rihanna and its aftermath, and
            the album did not sell as well as his first two releases. However,
            two years later Brown rebounded with the album F.A.M.E., which
            became his first number one album on the Billboard 200 chart and won
            him a Grammy Award for best R&B album.
            <br />
            In 2012 Brown released the chart-topping Fortune. That same year he
            and Rihanna released remixes of each other’s songs via the social
            networking site Twitter, and he was featured on a song on her album
            Unapologetic. The collaborations sparked rumours of romantic
            reconciliation; in early 2013 Rihanna confirmed that the two had
            begun dating again, but they broke up later that year. In October
            2013 Brown was charged with assaulting a man outside a hotel, a
            violation of his 2009 probation that ultimately resulted in him
            serving more than 100 days in jail in 2014. The incident—to which he
            later pled guilty—followed a series of altercations, several of
            which involved other musicians. Despite his legal troubles, Brown
            continued to record. His subsequent albums included X (2014), which
            features guest appearances by Lil Wayne and R. Kelly; Royalty
            (2015), named for his daughter; and the double albums Heartbreak on
            a Full Moon (2017) and Indigo (2019). The mixtape Slime & B (2020)
            is a collaboration with rapper Young Thug.
